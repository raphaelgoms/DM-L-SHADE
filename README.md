# DM-L-SHADE

This repository present the code of a proposal of hybridization of the evolutionary algorithm L-SHADE (Success-History based Adaptive Differential Evolution with  Linear Population Size Reduction) with Data Mining methods. 

The implementation was written above the L-SHADE code of Tanabe and Fukunaga [[1](#references)], available [HERE](https://ryojitanabe.github.io/code/LSHADE1.0.1_CEC2014.zip).

In our implementation L-SHADE was hybridized with two Clustering Methods (K-means [[2](#references)] and X-means [[3](#references)]). But, we pretend try the hybridization with other DM methods.
